This is a simple bug that I had encountered in the previous AirBnB clone API project. As a student at ALX, I had yet to face a company-wide outage, but the goal of this task is to explore, learn and practice the structure and best practices to write a real-world postmortem. So, if you think that this is a simple bug that does not require writing a professional postmortem, you’re right. Please don’t judge me.
